# Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation in C++ using OMNeT++ IDE

## About Raft
Raft is a consensus algorithm designed for simplicity and understandability, maintaining fault-tolerance and performance equivalency to Paxos. It breaks down the consensus problem into manageable subproblems, addressing all major aspects needed for practical systems implementation.

## Project Goals
This project aims to implement the Raft algorithm in C++ utilizing the OMNeT++ IDE, a simulation environment suited for testing networks and distributed systems. Through this implementation, we endeavor to exhibit the practical workings of Raft, providing a hands-on platform for understanding and experimenting with consensus in fault-tolerant distributed systems.
